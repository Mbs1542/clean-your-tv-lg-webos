# Homebrew Installer development and promotion

[Installer status and requirements](README.md) ·
[Physical acceptance record](../docs/development/HOMEBREW-INSTALL-ACCEPTANCE.md)

## Reproducible candidate preparation

Keep `build_payload(...)`, `build_installer(...)` and the existing
`homebrew/build.py` CLI as the build API. Build Root, Root Updater and supervisor
from the candidate source; use `cytv.python_runtime.prime_cache` to authenticate
the original runtime before `build_payload` normalizes it. `runtime-provenance.json`
records its original immutable URL, SHA256, size and normalized hash. Runtime
licenses are bundled with that archive, and Noto fonts carry OFL files. Project
source is [MIT licensed](../LICENSE); see [third-party notices](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)
and the pinned [runtime source contract](../cytv/python_runtime.py).

`cytv.yml` has an optional `homebrew_candidate` manual input. Its `homebrew` job
also runs with normal candidate installer builds; it uses no signing secret and
uploads only a `homebrew-candidate` CI artifact. Its failure is optional unless
acceptance selects the current frozen project release; selected promotion requires
both the successful workflow and a successful Homebrew job. Stale approval records
for unrelated release tags keep the build optional. It defaults to installer **0.0.0**,
which is a development version and cannot be promoted. Candidate URL strings in
its manifest reserve an intended immutable release path; no reachability is
claimed. CI build success is not hardware acceptance.

Generate metadata only after the final IPK exists:

```sh
python3 scripts/homebrew-manifest.py --ipk /absolute/path/installer.ipk \
  --ipk-url https://github.com/Razdva122/clean-your-tv-lg-webos/releases/download/vX.Y.Z/com.cleanyourtv.installer_A.B.C_all.ipk \
  --icon-url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Razdva122/clean-your-tv-lg-webos/COMMIT/assets/icons/installer-256.png \
  --output /absolute/path/homebrew-manifest.json
```

Replace the example version/commit tokens at candidate freeze; they are not
valid release inputs. The generator derives id, title, type, installer version,
installed bytes, IPK size and SHA256 from the actual package. It requires
`rootRequired: true`, HTTPS project release URLs, and validates the outer offline
inventory, inner component inventories/versions, runtime binding, provenance and
runtime inventory without executing any package or bundle code. Only this fixed
installer reader allows the bounded large runtime member; ordinary IPKs retain
their 16 MiB per-member limit.

## Acceptance and existing release gate

There is deliberately **no `homebrew/release.json`** in this candidate. Without it,
assembly ignores Homebrew CI artifacts and includes no installer, catalog
manifest or feed in the public asset list. Do not create that file until real
human and TV acceptance has been recorded. At freeze record the installer version
independently from product versions and bind the exact accepted bytes:

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "release": "vX.Y.Z",
  "version": "A.B.C",
  "ipk_sha256": "EXACT_ACCEPTED_IPK_SHA256",
  "manifest_sha256": "EXACT_ACCEPTED_MANIFEST_BYTES_SHA256",
  "ipk_url": "IMMUTABLE_PROJECT_RELEASE_IPK_URL",
  "icon_url": "IMMUTABLE_PUBLIC_ICON_URL",
  "source_url": "PUBLIC_PROJECT_SOURCE_URL",
  "hardware_acceptance": "Named record: model, webOS, firmware, hashes and all Task 8 results",
  "human_review": "Named human reviewer, meaningful review/test record and AI disclosure"
}
```

This is documentation, not acceptance evidence. Keep generated manifest formatting
unchanged after acceptance: its exact bytes are pinned. Freeze URLs too; the CI
job reuses them from the acceptance record. Accepting exact artifact hashes avoids
a circular source-commit requirement when adding acceptance changes the Git SHA.
The accepted artifacts still must come from the existing successful trusted
candidate build and exact merge-tree gate; a successful `homebrew` job becomes
required when the acceptance `release` matches the current project release. The
record selects only that frozen release; later unrelated releases ignore it for
fresh promotion and use verified carry-forward. A new installer needs its own
version, originating release and exact acceptance record. No independent publisher or signing bypass exists.

`assemble-release.py` verifies accepted bytes before copying them; existing
SHA256SUMS generation includes both manifest and IPK. `prepare-release.py` verifies
accepted Homebrew artifacts again before existing signed-feed preparation.
Signing and publication also require the approval in BUILD-INFO to equal
`homebrew/release.json` at its verified source commit; mutable release metadata
cannot independently grant acceptance. Keep the originating acceptance record
unchanged while carrying that installer across unrelated releases. On a
later unrelated release, it carries the previously verified acceptance record,
manifest and IPK forward unchanged if no new installer is selected. Embedded
product versions remain those of the accepted installer, not the newer project
release. Orphan/unaccepted assets are never adopted. Installer regression or a
changed approval/artifact without an installer version increase fails.

The catalog's one intended stable endpoint is
`https://github.com/Razdva122/clean-your-tv-lg-webos/releases/latest/download/homebrew-manifest.json`.
Carry-forward keeps that file present across unrelated releases while preserving
the original immutable `ipkUrl`. `publish-release.cjs` checks checksum membership,
exact accepted metadata, data-only inventories and package bytes again, and
fetches the original release IPK to verify that URL still serves the accepted
bytes. It rejects unaccepted/orphan public installer assets. This happens in the
existing protected publication/check-only path; normal signing, checksum, source
and product-feed gates stay authoritative. Publication is followed by the existing
check-only verification; missing assets or verification failures block success.

## Catalog review

`catalog/cleanyourtv-installer.yml` targets upstream apps-repo `PackageInfo.json`
(category `utility`, pool `main`). Generated metadata targets
`api/PackageManifest.json`. Its planned URLs and screenshot omissions must be
resolved before submission. Schema success cannot establish URL availability.
Validate against current upstream validators at submission time, using bounded
network checks and without executing downloaded application code. The draft was
checked against apps-repo commit `291da2bce269fbc901a0716b645caf64f709e3dc`.

Required remaining evidence: public HTTPS URLs, representative TV screenshots,
package staging/storage measurement, clean HBC setup, both cytv/TV handoffs,
upgrade/rollback, explicit optional supervisor behavior, direct installer and
component removal, triple-Home, standby and separate cold boot. Record exact
artifacts and human review. AI assistance was used for implementation and this
draft; disclose it in the eventual submission. Do not submit the catalog draft
or publish Homebrew assets before those gates pass.


Unreleased cold-boot correction: rooted SDK DATA may have ordinary `0777` modes.
The corrected private readers require independent original package hashes; they
do not repair shared permissions or execute shared source. Missing/conflicting
current, transaction or own-package proof keeps automatic Home rearm inhibited,
while independent private LG Home restoration remains available. Deliver the
changed helper closure through checked fresh setup/rebootstrap, preserving
existing recovery archives and unknown-operation records. Updating Installer
alone does not replace retained private product code. Root remains disabled until
an explicit activation through the normal setup/settings flow. See the
[candidate authority and acceptance record](../docs/development/HOMEBREW-INSTALL-ACCEPTANCE.md#cold-boot-data-authority-correction).
